Our community is known as the **Aspects of Love**. It was started by Sudo/Tirzah/LoveSudoNimh so long ago that she can't remember the exact date. She wanted to offer a place where members could play games together, connect, and grow. Now it exists as a Free Company in FFXIV as well as being what she collectively calls her stream's community.

We have core values, a code of conduct, and even a few recommended reading/watching resources to help understand us better.

## Our Core Values

_These core values are our definition of respect._

### Be better today than yesterday.

Being better is more important than being the “best”, because “best” means complacency and better means progress. We are always improving. Improvement requires reflection, so we take ownership of our mistakes and question our habits.

### Treat others the way they’d like to be treated.

Our community members have different needs from our own, so we must consider their perspectives to communicate effectively. We work best together when we empathize with one another, and we create the best community when we understand the members we engage with.

### Fight the default of exclusion.

Inequality and exclusion are the defaults of our society. Without intentional effort, we will inherit those failings and worsen the problem. Building a diverse community is a moral imperative and we grow as individuals by bringing different perspectives to the table. We look for voices unlike our own because they are the only ones that help us grow.

### We succeed together when we trust each other.

Trust is the currency that powers every interaction. Only when we trust each other can we share the candid feedback and opinions that let us be creative and successful. We give our members deep visibility into how our decisions are made and easy outlets to help them give input and guide our course. When we build trust through good communication, we create an environment for better communication in the future.

### Engage in positive conflict resolution.

Conflict is defined as two, or more, individuals who have a disagreement about a topic. We understand that this will happen, but we strive to allow every member a chance to use positive conflict resolution tools such as listening, empathising, seeking clarity of different opinions, and then working together towards compromise. How we handle disagreements and conflicts empowers each member to grow wiser.

## Our Code of Conduct

_How we try to engage with each other and others._

### Be Mindful

Mindfulness is defined as the quality or state of being conscious or aware of something. To us, “something” is the community as a whole, as well as the individual members of it. Don’t take their time, energy, or attention for granted.

### Maturity

We believe age doesn’t define maturity. While maturity is a learned concept and not instinctual, the key to our entire code of conduct is based on responding to the community and members in an appropriate manner. What do we define as appropriate? See our core values.

### Communication/Engagement/Encouragement

To us, intent behind words is everything. We believe that to have a community, communication and engagement must occur between the members. Without it, there is no community, no individual growth. We feel that to be successful we must encourage the community as a whole, and also the individuals found within.
