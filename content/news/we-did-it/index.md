Week two, and several groups have made it through even more content!

<!--more-->

I have to start with my own group, the Inflatable Friends static! We cleared P6S for the first time! Congrats to all! It only took us having Luna become a chicken, and Lysias to bare his chest. Lesson learned! You can watch our clear here. Fio did perfectly. Promise. I didn't try to kill our them. Promise!
